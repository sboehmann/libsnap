The libsnap project provides free LGPL-licensed S.N.A.P. tools and libraries.

S.N.A.P., the Scaleable Node Address Protocol, is a simple and lightweight network 
protocol original designed for home automation products.

The libsnap library is completely written in C, supports the full S.N.A.P 
specification and adds various extensions.

The libsnap project also provides useful software tools for development with S.N.A.P.


h2(#goals).  The goals of libsnap are:
* Provide a reliable implementation of the S.N.A.P specification
* A small footprint so that it can be used on many embedded devices
* The library should run on as many devices and platforms as possible
* Easily usable from other languages
